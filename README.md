You have 20 shots to detect a 3x1 ship on a 8x8 grid.
The ship can be aligned horizontal, vertical or 
diagonal.

**How to play:**
Enter the coordinated and fire (Button F).
If you hit the ship, the mostright counter
will jump to 01.

If you hit all 3 coordinates of the ship, 
you won, the display will show "dEAd" and the number of 
shots used.
